# cypress-basico-v2

Sample project for the basic course of the Talking About Testing online school.

## Pre-requisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v22.4.1` and `10.8.2` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same version or a more recent one.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the development dependencies.

## Tests

You can run the tests simulating a desktop or mobile viewport.

### Desktop

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the tests in headless mode on a desktop viewport.

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode on a desktop viewport.

### Mobile

Run `npm run test:mobile` to run the tests in headless mode on a mobile viewport.

Or, run `npm run cy:open:mobile` to open Cypress in interactive mode on a mobile viewport.
